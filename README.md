# AlphaFold DB notebooks

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks designed to help users access, query, and analyze protein structures from the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database (AFDB). Each notebook demonstrates a different method for interacting with the database.

## Notebooks Overview

1. AFDB_3DBeacons.ipynb
Best for: Discovering structures across multiple databases and performing sequence-based searches.
Demonstrates how to access AlphaFold models through the 3D-Beacons Network, a federated network of protein structure data resources.

2. AFDB_API.ipynb
Best for: Quick, direct programmatic access to specific protein entries and visualization.
Provides a tutorial on using the direct AlphaFold Database API endpoints to retrieve data for specific proteins.

3. AFDB_BigQuery.ipynb
Best for: Complex queries, metadata analysis, and filtering the entire dataset (200M+ structures).
Explains how to use Google BigQuery to search the massive metadata table of the AlphaFold DB.

4. AFDB_FTP.ipynb
Best for: Bulk downloading of entire proteomes or large datasets.
Provides instructions and code to access the AlphaFold DB FTP server for bulk data retrieval.
